# Spatial intelligence for the Energy Transition (Shiny App)

_Does Amsterdam (e.g) have the space for transitioning to a 'green' city by 2040?_

- DataWrangling.R -> Pulling the neccesary data from _KlimaatMonitor_ and manipulating it
- Shapefiles.R -> Working with geospatial data (due manipulations)
- Population.R -> Pulling demographics data from CBS (Central Bureau of Statistics)
- Nature.R -> Pulling natural resources data from CBS once again

                   ### MVP
- GEShinyapp.R -> Creating **the interactive dashboard**:
   - To provide insights for all municipalities in the _Netherlands_
   - To create 'live' graphs for all data mentioned above
   
   
- Branch (Boxtel_shinyapp_versions) -> Application showing information onyl for the municipality of **Boxtel** (Regio Nord Brabant)
- timeSeries.R -> Attempt at **forecasting** future energy demand
